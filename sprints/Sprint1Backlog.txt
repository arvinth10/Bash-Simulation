Sprint 1 Backlog.  
February 17 to February 22

a) Complete CRC cards

User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
b) As a user I want to control the file system through keyboard inputs
c) As a user I expect to be notified if I enter an invalid input
d) As a user I want to exit the program whenever I want to   
e) As a user I want to be able to make directory 
f) As a user I want to be able to navigate through the file system  

g) Update CRC cards

Specific tasks to be accomplished:
a-1. Collaborate together and pick the best set of CRC cards
b-1. (JShell) Begin coding the structure of the command line interpreter
b-2. (JShell) Have the shell continually prompt the user for input
b-3. (JShell) Parse the user input for proper keywords
b-4. (JShell) Check if commands entered by user is valid using a validator instance
c-1. (Validator) Check if input is correct by looking at the number of arguments and the arguments itself
c-2. (Validator) Print error message if input is invalid
c-3. (Validator) Store every command entered by user and create a method that can return all these commands/user input
d-1. (JShell) Stop program when exit command entered
e-1. (Handler) Write the base code for the handler class 
e-2. (Directory) write the base code for directory so you are able to create new directories when user wants to, and keep track of all directories
e-3. (Directory) Write base code for directory class, do not need to completely implement it. Do it so you can use directory class for directory handler
f-1. (Directory) Begin implementation of the directory class by adding appropriate instance variables
f-2. (Directory) Find a way for a directory to keep track of its contents and implement it 
f-3. (cd) Implement the class so user is able change the current directory to another directory given a file path
f-4. (cd) Add method to the class by enabling the user to change the current directory to another directory that is relative to the current directory
f-5. (cd) Add method to class so user can revert to the parent directory
f-6. (cd) Add method to class so user can revert to the root directory 
g-1. Update the CRC cards
