What did I do last time?
    - Complete Copy and Move classes and added a parent class to these two classes
    called ChangeFileSystem
    - Started Grep class

What do I plan to do now?
	- Complete Grep command
	- Fix newObject method and possibly add it to another method to shorten total code
	- Write a JUnit tests
	- Implement Singleton design pattern 
	- Document all code, and update CRC cards 
	
Am I blocked on anything?
    - How am I recursively going to search through a directory?
