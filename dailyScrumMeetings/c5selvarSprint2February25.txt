What did I work on last time?
	- Completed History class
	- Implemented method to an Array List of all recent commands
	- Implemented another method to return a list of all recent commands after a specific numbe
	- Almost done Mkdir class implementation
What do I plan to do now?
	- Finish Mkdir class coding
	- Begin working on an stdout and stderr class to output results and errors that are produced by history commands, cat command, and others,
	- Consult with group and instructor on our current Design for program and what improvements we can make
Am I blocked on anything?
	- Instructor suggested to use polymorphism for standard output and standard error classes, but I do not really understand what polymorphism really is at the moment.
