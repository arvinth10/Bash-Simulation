What did I work on last time?
	- Finished up most of the crc Cards with group, still need to fix some crc cards, given the feedback from prof Abbass 
	- Finished up the product backlog with group
	- Finished the sprint1 backlog and assigned the tasks to all group members
	- Began brainstorming how to implement and code the classes required to complete my tasks in the current sprint

What do I plan to do now?
	- Finish all crc cards and update them according to professors feedback 
	- Begin to work on the writing base code for directory
	- Start implementing the ls command in ls class.
	- Start implmenting the cd command

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Need to create a prototype for ls, cd, and directory class to begin coding.
