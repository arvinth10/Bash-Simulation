What did I work on last time?
   - Almost done implementing new ls addition
   - Made changes to ls to make it more modular
What do I plan to do now?
   - Fix errors in history command (error came after implementation of the new addition requirements)
   - Complete tasks for A2
   - Change FileSystem and Handler classes interms of sigleton design pattern
   - Add testcases to existing JUnit tests for new additions of the existing classes
   - Create JUnit Tests for new classes I made

Am I blocked on anything?
   - nothing at the moment
