What did I do last time?
    - Created Handler class to track the current path
    - Created Validator class to check the correctness of input command

What do I plan to do now?
	- Try to make clear the responsibilities of every class
	- Consider the plan for next sprint
	- Update CRC cards 

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Confusing responsibilities for every class
    - need a method to get the contents of a directory given its name or path
