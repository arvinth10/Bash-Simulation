What did I do last time?
    - Fixed up Cd and Echo classes so they can be inherited by Command class
    - Cd now takes Handler object as parameter to change working directory 
    - Added Ls class 

What do I plan to do now?
	- Complete the Ls class
	- Continue onto Sprint 3 
	- Collaborate with group to get everything working together
	- Create JUnit tests 
	
Am I blocked on anything?
    - How do I check if a file exists from an absolute or relative path?
