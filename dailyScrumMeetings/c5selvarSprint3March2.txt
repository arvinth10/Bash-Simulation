What did I do last time?
	- Changed implementation of Directory class since we have decided to use Hashtables to store directories/Files with the path as the key
		- Previously had a nested list and was difficult to find a directory/file object given a path using recursion.
	- Updated Mkdir class such that it works with new implementation
What do I plan to do now?
	- Complete implementation of stderr class
	- Help teammates and complete implementation of other classes
	- Get Jshell running
	- Start writting JUnitTests for all the classes with the team

Am I blocked on anything?
	Nothing at the moment
