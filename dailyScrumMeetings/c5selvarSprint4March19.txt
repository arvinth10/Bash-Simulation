What did I do last time?
	- Fixed some bugs in validator that did not allow some methods to work from A2a
	- Almost done new addition task for cat command, have a small confusion
What do I plan to do now?
	- Complete the task of cat implementation
	- Fix the implementation of recursive feature implementation of ls command (There is an error)
Am I blocked on anything?
	- Not sure exactly what to add to the cat command, I may have already implemented it in A2a.
