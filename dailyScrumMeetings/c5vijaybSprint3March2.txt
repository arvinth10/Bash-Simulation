What did I do last time?
    - Changes to Cd so methods are not repeated in other classes 
    - Completed Ls
    - Added Hashtables to FileSystem
    

What do I plan to do now?
	- Finish the FileSystem
	- Complete the implementation of echo based on new FileSystem
	- Continue onto Sprint 3 
	- Collaborate with group to get everything working together
	- Create JUnit tests 
	
Am I blocked on anything?
