What did I do last time?
	- Completed Mkdir class
	- Almost have done implementing ls class
	- Helped implement FileSystem class
	- Completed JShell and validator class, such that basic inputs work
	- Updated PWD class to work

What do I plan to do now?
	- Complete ls class
	- Complete implementing Cat class
	- Complete JUnit tests for my classes
	- Add JavaDocs for all methods of my classes

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Need teammate to add a method in FileSystem that will return a File object given a path. This will allow me to complete ls class.
	- Also will allow me to complete the cat class
	- This addition will help teammate complete echo class.
