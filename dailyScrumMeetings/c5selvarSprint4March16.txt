What did I do last time?
	- Thought of design for my tasks
	- Wrote down how I am going to implement those tasks 

What do I plan to do now?
	- Fix bug in validator class 
	- Add to the ls clss so you can recursively get contents of a directory and all its subdirectories
	- Complete the cat command

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Nothing at the moment
