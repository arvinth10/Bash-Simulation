What did I do last time?
    - Updated move and copy commands fixing some errors
    - Completed grep command
    - Made newObject method shorter, removing code not needed 

What do I plan to do now?
	- Complete the move and copy command so it recursively copies/moves all 
	directories within a directory
	- Document all code and update CRC cards
	- Fix newObject method and possibly add it to another method to shorten total code
	- Write a JUnit tests
	- Implement Singleton design pattern 
	- Document all code, and update CRC cards 
	
Am I blocked on anything?
    - How do I recursively move directories within a directory
